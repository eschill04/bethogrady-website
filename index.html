                <h3>ABOUT</h3>
                <p>I am primarily a painter and sculptor. I enjoy working with shapes, patterns, and colors. Most of my artwork is 
                    nonrepresentational or abstract. I strive to create a strong visual impact using simple structures. During the 
                    past four years I experimented with corrugated cardboard, and cutting wood with a scroll saw. I also made stop 
                    motion videos with some of the cardboard and wood pieces, where I explored movement, sound, and story telling. 
                    In 2025, I am drawing with graphite and colored pencil, and painting with acrylic and charcoal on canvas and wood panel.

                <h3>STUDIO</h3>
                <p>My studio is located in the attic of my New Jersey home. 
                    It's a peaceful place that overlooks trees, farmland, and 
                    distant hills.
                </p>
